  My name is Víctor Ballester and I am currently pursing my master degree M2 in Applied Mathematics at Paris-Dauphine University. I am writing to express my interest in the \intern\ in Turkey.

  For years I have been highly attracted to Applied Mathematics, and in particular, to fluid dynamics and numerical analysis. My past university studies have given me the insights to become familiar with concepts of analysis and theory of differential equations. Here in Paris, I have been able to deepen my knowledge in these subjects, specially in the fields of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Computational Fluid Dynamics. As this internship programme in Turkey do have some courses related to PDEs, I am very interested in participating in it. If I am admitted to the program I would like to follow at least the courses of \textit{PDEs on manifolds} (done by Dr.\ Padi Fuster Aguilera and Dr.\ Aram Bingham) and \textit{Math for Artificial Intelligence} (done by Özgür Bozkurt). The first one would allow me to deepen my knowledge in PDEs and the second one would give me the opportunity to learn more about the applications of Math in AI.

  In addition to the academic aspects, the opportunity presented at the Nesin Maths Village offers an exciting chance for me to delve into Turkey's gastronomy by contributing to meal organization. Furthermore, I am enthusiastic about assisting with various village chores such as cleaning or gardening. Taking on these responsibilities will not only foster a sense of community but also  provide me with a unique opportunity to learn about Turkish culture and traditions. I find this summer program very unique, as it differs from conventional internships.

  On balance, I am highly motivated to spend part of my summer vacations participating in this program while further expanding my knowledge in the field of Applied Mathematics. Therefore, receiving this grant would facilitate me to achieve my goals.

  Thank you very much for considering my application.

  Yours faithfully,

  Víctor Ballester
